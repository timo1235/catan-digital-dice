# 🎲 Catan Digital Dice – ESP32-C3 Powered

![Overview](docs/assets/catan-dice-summary.png)

A smart digital dice module made specifically for **The Settlers of Catan**. Featuring a vibrant TFT screen, intuitive button controls, and multiple dice modes including full expansion support. The device integrates magnetically into the board by replacing a desert or water hex in the **Danzkala 2.0 terrain system**.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Two Dice Modes**:
  - *Realistic Probability*: Follows true dice distribution (7 most common, 2 and 12 rare).
  - *Equal Probability*: Each number (2–12) has an equal chance of appearing. Adds a fun and unexpected twist to your games!

- 🏰 **Expansion Support**:
  - *Cities & Knights*: Adds a custom pirate/fortress die.
  - *Traders & Barbarians*: Includes a colored event die.

- 📈 **Live Dice Statistics**:
  - Hold the roll button to show stats of all numbers rolled so far.
  - End the “my number never comes up” arguments — now with proof!

- 🔋 **Energy Saving Mode**:
  - Optional auto-sleep after 5 or 10 minutes (or disable sleep entirely).
  - In deep sleep: ~0.5mA power draw.
  - Example: A 1000 mAh battery can last ~80 days in standby.

- ⚡ **USB Charging via TP4056 module**

- 📊 **Battery Level Indicator on-screen**

- 💾 **All settings are saved** even after power-off

- 🔁 **Dice stats reset** on power-up or returning to menu

![Steps 7–12](docs/assets/catan-dice-steps7-12.png)

### 🧰 Assembly Steps Overview

1. **Dry-fit all components** in the housing to check spacing and placement. This helps visualize the layout and confirms the correct installation order.
2. **Prepare the ESP32-C3 Super Mini** by soldering **female pin headers** to one side only (the display-facing side). Leave the other side unsoldered for now — you'll connect the switches and power later.
3. **Prepare the TP4056 module**:
   - Solder equally long wires to all pins (they’ll be trimmed to size later).
   - Solder two **equal-value resistors** (e.g., 51 kΩ) to form a **voltage divider** for battery monitoring. Connect the midpoint with a wire — this will later go to the ESP32's ADC input.
4. *(Optional)*: If using a front cover or decorative frame for the display, glue it on now.
5. Place the **TP4056 module** into its position in the case.
6. Install the **16 mm main push button** and solder all wires with equal lengths. I recommend connecting one **switch pin and the LED's GND pin** together early on.
7. Mount the **1.77" TFT display** and install the **12 mm menu button**, again using equal-length wires.
   - Also connect the **OUT- pin** from the TP4056 to the **GND of the main button** — I use this GND as a central **ground distribution point**.
   - Connect the **menu button’s GND** to this shared ground as well.
8. Install the **15 mm on/off switch**.
   - Connect **OUT+ from the TP4056** to one side of the switch.
   - The other wire from the switch will later go to the **5 V input on the ESP32**.
   - Use a bit of **hot glue** to secure the display and loose wires if needed.
9. Insert the **16340 Li-Ion battery** into the housing and secure it with hot glue.
   - Connect **battery – (negative)** to **B-** on the TP4056.
   - Connect **battery + (positive)** to **B+** on the TP4056.
10. **Wire the ESP32-C3** according to the following pin layout:
    - Main button switch → `GPIO0`
    - Main button + (LED) → `GPIO1`
    - Menu button switch → `GPIO2`
    - Menu button + (LED) → `GPIO3`
    - Voltage divider wire (middle point between resistors) → `GPIO4`
    - On/off switch output → `5V`
    - Shared GND from the 16 mm button (ground hub) → `GND`
11. Plug the **ESP32 module onto the display’s pin header**.
12. Flip the switch, power on — and **test your build**. You're done!

## 🔋 Battery Options & Runtime

  - A **16340 Li-Ion cell** fits perfectly into the case. These are inexpensive on AliExpress — but be careful: I tested one labeled *2800 mAh* and it only delivered **150 mAh** under load.
  - I now use this more reliable version from pulsebox - found on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3XQ1e4Q), which is a bit more expensive but delivered **around 560 mAh** of its claimed 950 mAh — good for roughly **10 hours of continuous dice usage**.
  - If you want **higher capacity**, these also fit (snugly):
    - [803040 (1000 mAh)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ool9yJB)
    - [103040 (1200 mAh)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ool9yJB)
  - Alternatively, you can **omit the battery** and simply connect a **USB cable** to a power bank or charger — totally optional and up to personal preference.

| Battery | Claimed Capacity | Measured | Estimated Runtime |
|--------|------------------|----------|--------------------|
| 16340 (AliExpress) | 2800mAh | 150mAh | ~3 hrs |
| 16340 (Amazon) | 950mAh | 560mAh | ~10 hrs |
| 103040 | 1200mAh | ?? | ~18–20 hrs |
| Deep Sleep | 1000mAh | — | ~80 days standby |
